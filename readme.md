# project description with goals

In this project we will be looking at a dataset of customer data from ficticious telecom company (Telco). We will attempt to predict the probablity that any given customer will churn (end their service subscriptions with Telco) based on factors such as monthly charges, billing type, gender and payment method. The data used in this project is static and will not be used for predictions on future customers.
